  	- 082718 - multiple mid notches for different size containers (see Tested example)
  	- 082718 - top and bottom notch for stacking (see Tested example)
  	- 082718 - [34mm bottles] proper sized side notch holes for material being used (add annotation for users to remember to change this)
  	- 082718 - bottom floor (notch) needs to be higher to accomodate stacking notch
  	- 082718 - etch label on side so container type can be known if containers are obscured (see Tested example)
